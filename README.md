# Food-Delivery-Website

A debut web development project aimed at showcasing an online food delivery service in India. Built using HTML5 and CSS3, it features a responsive design with sections for Home, Services, Our Clients, and Contact Us. The website introduces users to various food services including catering, bulk ordering, and food ordering, complete with a user-friendly navigation bar and a contact form for inquiries.

Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Google Fonts. This project taught me the fundamentals of web development, responsive design, and user experience considerations.
